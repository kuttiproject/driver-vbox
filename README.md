## Images
This driver depends on VirtualBox VM images published via the [kuttiproject/driver-vbox-images](https://github.com/kuttiproject/driver-vbox-images) repository. The details of the driver-to-VM interface are documented there. 

The releases of that repository are the default source for this driver. The mater list of available/deprecated images and the images themselves are published there. The releases match the major and minor versions of this repository, and vice versa.
